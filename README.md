### Overview
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write **Terraform** that can be used to deploy the three-tiered "click counter" application contained in this repository. Use the `front`, `back`, and `redis` images detailed below.

- Use Dockerfile in the `front` directory of this repo to build `front` image
- Use Dockerfile in the `back` directory of this repo to build `back` image
- Push built images to free container registry like Dockerhub, Github Packages, or AWS ECR
- Use any version of `redis` from Dockerhub
- Use AWS free-tier option(s) like **ECS fargate ** and/or **Lambda + API Gateway** for running containers
- Use **Terraform**, your choice of CI/CD solution, and/or any additional scripting to deploy the containers
- Use  **AWS Memory DB for redis**

If you have questions or something seems "not right", please reach out via email.

### Application details
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
- `back` app
    - Requires these ENV vars:
        - `REDIS_SERVER` - Address of Redis container in the form of `<host>:<port>`
    - Binds to port
        - `4000`
    - Provides these endpoints:
        - `/api/clicks` - Returns current click count
        - `/api/clicks/incr` - Increments click count by 1 and returns new click count
        - `/api/ping` - Returns static "pong" response
- `front` app
    - Requires these ENV vars:
        - `BACKEND_API_URL` - Address of the Back container reachable from the server-side in the form of `http://<host>`
        - `CLIENT_API_URL` -  Address of the Back container reachable from the client-side in the form of `http://<host>`
        - Note: depending on how you've networked the containers, these to vars could be the same
    - Binds to port
        -  `3000`
    - Provides:
        - `/`  - Click counter display/UI
        - `/ping` - Returns static "pong" response

- `redis` image
    - Requires these ENV vars:
        - None
    - Binds to port
        - `6379`

### Extra credit
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
- Hide the `3000`/`4000` ports and make the service available over port `80` using the method of your choice
- Add healthchecks to `front` and `back` apps using the ping endpoint each app provides
- Implement basic security measures
- Add DNS or other customizations

- Do the same using docker compose, minikube


### Actions to perform
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
First, you should start by setting up your AWS profile and obtaining the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. 
These credentials are essential for adding a secret to your GitHub repository. Once you have your AWS access credentials,
proceed to create your GitHub repository. Afterward, include my repository within yours.

Once you've completed the initial steps mentioned above, to fulfill the top-priority task, navigate to your 
GitHub Actions to execute the following workflows:
- [Github_actions](.github/workflows/#github_actions)
- `baсk`,`front`,`S3 create`, and `aws_stage_create`

During the execution of the final workflow, you will receive output variables, such as alb_hostname, 
for example: `main-load-balancer-1765173796.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
This is your endpoint for the front-end application.

In this manner, you will successfully complete the task.

Don't forget to run workflows aws_stage_destroy , s3_destroy to delete all of the above

### Performing еxtra credit
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
to use docker compose, just go to the main directory and follow these steps.

-`docker compose build`

-`docker compose up -d`
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
to use minikube

go to the terraform directory - [Terraform](terraform/#terraform)
and execute :
-`terraform init`

-`terraform apply`
